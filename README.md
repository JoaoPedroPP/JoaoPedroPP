My name is JoÃ£o Pedro, but you can call me as JP, I'm Software Engineer who likes to solve problems and passionate about science and technology. During my life as a developer many problems I faced I shared my solutions here and when I was not able to solve alone I found many people here with similar problems and willing to help, and that is the thing I most admire about Open Source.

Here you can find some porjects I did in my life, most of them related with C, Node.js, Python, Angular 2, some of them with deploy script in containers and kubernetes.
